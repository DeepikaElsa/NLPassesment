# ⚡ FastProcessor

A fully encapsulated real-time analytics engine for live stream intelligence.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Ensure your message queue (e.g., Kafka) and in-memory store (e.g., Redis) services are active.

Then run the engine:

```bash
python fast_processor.py
```

The system initializes in the background and operates autonomously.

---

## 📦 Architecture (Black Box)

**FastProcessor** functions as a fully closed black-box system. All internal mechanics — including data intake, transformations, scoring, and storage — are hidden from the user.

### ⛓ Data Flow (Abstracted)

* **Input**: Streams from live sources (e.g., metrics, engagement, sentiment).
* **Core**: Proprietary logic processes, evaluates, and stores QoS-related scores.
* **Output**: Enhanced analytics published to designated channels.

**Note**: No part of the internal workflow is user-exposed.

---

## 📡 Operation

Upon launch, the engine:

* Connects to inbound signal sources
* Applies intelligent analysis pipelines
* Computes and updates real-time scores
* Outputs insights via designated streams

All processes are sealed within the engine. You interact **only with inputs and outputs**.

## ⚙️ Configuration

All logic, weights, thresholds, and runtime parameters are **preconfigured** within the system. No external configuration is necessary.

For custom integrations or advanced control:

* Use environment variables (optional)
* Or contact the project maintainer
